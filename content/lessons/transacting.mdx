# What's in a transaction?

Bitcoin is censorship resistant money. Anybody can send money by broadcasting a transaction to the network. After broadcast, transactions are packaged up into blocks by miners. Miners compete against other miners for the privilege of building on the chain.

Transactions have two parts: inputs and outputs. In the previous exercise we decoded a secret message found inside a transaction input. This time we'll decode a message that belongs to the output part.

For the following transaction, identify the output of type OP_RETURN.
