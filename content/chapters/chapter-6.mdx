You get a phone call. It’s the reporter. He tracked down Vanderpoole who is hiding on one of his private islands and plotting his revenge.

Ever since you discredited Vanderpoole, investors have been selling Amestris shares en masse and decreasing his net worth. He’s really not that rich, after all, and now he is trying to claim your UTXOs belong to him.

The reporter tells you to stay safe, but you’re not too worried. You hang up the phone, but there’s a problem: it’s been hacked.
