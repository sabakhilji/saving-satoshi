Phew, that was close. You are still shaking from your battle against Amestris, yet relieved that a victory was possible.

As you settle at your desk, you take a deep breath and drift off to replay the day’s events. Your hands keep themselves busy playing with the mysterious envelope, as you wonder who sent it. Who still uses envelopes anyways, it’s 2139 after all. Even more curious is that there is a stamp on it, from 2008...could this be another hint?

Suddenly, you realize that you never claimed the block rewards from your competition with Amestris. Your bitcoin wallet is running low, so now’s a good time to top it up again.
